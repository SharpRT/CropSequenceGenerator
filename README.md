# CropSequenceGenerator

This repo contains matlab code to generate realistic cropping sequences for subregions of the UK.
The file cropseqgenerator.m is the main script

Here inputs can be changed at the top of the script including the number of fields and years over which to generate sequences and the region of the UK to use.

The other files contain functions used within the main script

Details of the methodology employed can be found in Sharp et al 2021 (under review)
